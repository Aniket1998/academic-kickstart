I'm a Pre-final Year Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering, broadly interested in the areas of Probabilistic Machine Learning and Approximate Inference, which I'm exploring as an Undergraduate Researcher under the mentorship of [Prof. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/).

My sophomore year research work centered around Representation Learning (with focus on Disentangled Representations) and Deep Generative Models for high dimensional sequential data. Under the supervision of [Prof. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/) and [Prof. Vinay Namboodiri](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/vinaypn/), I worked on developing hierarchical probabilistic models for joint video and image generation and disentangled representation learning for videos.

Lately, I've been fascinated by the many applications of Stein's Method in Machine Learning, ranging from Stein Variational Gradient Descent and Stein Point MCMC to Spectral Stein Gradient Estimation for Implicit Models. I'm currently working on this subject under Prof. Piyush Rai's guidance, trying to investigate application domains such as Amortized MCMC, Nonparametric KL Minimization, and optimization in Natural Parameter Space, where employing Stein's method may lead to improvements. I'm also very interested in the underlying theory of Gradient-Based MCMC Algorithms that function by simulating continuous deterministic or stochastic dynamics, such as (SG)HMC and (SG)LD, and their Riemmanian variants.

I've had some exposure to Optimization, though I'm much less acquainted with the subject than I'd like to be. To this end, I'm trying to explore the area of Nonparametric Stochastic Optimization and Online Kernel Learning under the supervision of [Prof. Ketan Rajawat](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/). I hope to explore Optimization and Learning Theory rigorously in the future.

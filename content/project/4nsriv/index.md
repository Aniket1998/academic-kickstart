Aimed to characterize the nature and granularity of information about social interactions accessible to human observers from simple visual displays. Studied lay theories of human emotion modelling and developed a computational model for social situations involving few agents, based on the Valence Arousal Model of emotion detection and the Social Force Model for Pedestrian Dynamics

Exploring avenues such as Amortized MCMC, Functional KL Minimization for Nonparametric Models, and optimization in Natural Parameter Space where employing Stein’s Method for Variational Inference or Gradient Estimation may lead to improvements. I am currently surveying the literature of Stein Gradient Estimators, Amortized MCMC Algorithms, and state of the art Natural Gradient and “Inference via Weight Perturbation” methods such as K-FAC and its variants, VADAM and VProp

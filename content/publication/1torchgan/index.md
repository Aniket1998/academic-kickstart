# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "TorchGAN is a PyTorch based framework for writing succinct and comprehensible code for training and evaluation of Generative Adversarial Networks. The framework's modular design allows effortless customization of the model architecture, loss functions, training paradigms, and evaluation metrics and its features bear almost zero overhead over vanilla PyTorch. Currently submitted to *Journal of Machine Learning Research: Machine Learning Open Source Software (JMLR MLOSS)*. An arXiv preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03410.pdf)
